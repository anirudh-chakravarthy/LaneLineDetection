## Lane Line Detection

<br/>
This project tries to detect Lane lines on Road Images using Python and OpenCV. The algorithm works reasonably well for images with low brightness as well.\


The processing has been carried out using the Caltech Pedestrian and Nexet datasets.\


The code can be run using the following command:
`python3 main.py`


\
The Caltech Pedestrian Dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/)
