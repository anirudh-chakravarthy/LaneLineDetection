## Lane Line Detection

<br/>
This project tries to detect Lane lines on Road Images using Python and OpenCV. The algorithm works reasonably well for images with low brightness as well.

<br/>
The processing has been carried out using the Caltech Pedestrian and Nexet datasets.

<br/>
The code can be run using the following command:
`python3 main.py`

<br/>
The Caltech Pedestrian Dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/)

The Nexet Dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.getnexar.com/challenge-2/)
